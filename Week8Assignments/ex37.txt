and: Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are true then then condition becomes true.

del: The del statement works by unbinding the name, removing it from the set of names known to the Python interpreter. 
	If this variable was the last remaining reference to an object, the object will be removed from memory. 
	If, on the other hand, other variables still refer to this object, the object won't be deleted.

from: import modules

not: not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, 
	so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.

while: The while loop continues until the expression becomes false. 
	The expression has to be a logical expression and must return either a true or a false value
		while expression:
   			statement(s)
   			
as

elif: The keyword ‘elif‘ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. 
	An if ... elif ... elif ... sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
	
global: If you want to assign a value to a name defined outside the function, 
	then you have to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global.
 	We do this using the global statement. It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a 
 	function without the global statement.
